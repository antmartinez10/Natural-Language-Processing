## Overview
This chatbot was built off a **knowledge base** that I created which stores book titles and authors for fiction and non-fiction books. The chatbot uses this knowledge base to make recommendations to the user. However, this chatbot can give human-like responses to user input. The chatbot was created using a **neural network** in order to accurately predicate suitable responses based on the userâ€™s input. Here is a screenshot of a sample interaction:
