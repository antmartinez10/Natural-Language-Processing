mjp founding member jul 20 2018 #28 one analytical academic things try tell story bukowski's life quoting work take faith everything wrote factual
they're pretty dry reading surprisingly get things wrong
suppose necessarily bad thing famous authors attract multiple biographers
necessarily good thing rely other's books establish "the truth"
that's they're
becomes echo chamber myth inaccuracy falsehoods
