John Martin offers to pay Bukowski a quarter of his own income ($100 a month at the time) "for life" if he quits the post office and writes full time. [December] As a clerk with 10 years on the job, Bukowski was making about $625 a month at the post office. As the story goes, Martin and Bukowski sat down and figured out that Bukowski could live on $100 a month. But the fact is, Bukowski was paying $45 a month for child support alone at the time, in addition to spending more than $50 on long distance phone calls, so the numbers in the story don't exactly add up. It's also worth noting that a year later Bukowski claimed to have savings of $90,000, so while the $100 a month was likely a welcome gesture, it was not the critical financial support it is often made out to be.($90,000 in savings may seem like a stretch for someone making $7,500 a year. Even if the number is exaggerated, considering 10 years on the post office job, the sale of his father's house, and the fact that he lived very frugally, Bukowski likely had considerable savings when Martin made his offer.)Starts magazine Laugh Literary and Man the Humping Guns with Neeli Cherkovski, it lasts three issues.

Santa Cruz St., San Pedro, CA 90731 [October]Bukowski buys the house for $80,000 (a 1979 Los Angeles Times article puts the price at $120,000), and lives at this address longer than any other during his lifetime.He was only making $6000 a year from his Black Sparrow books at the time, but his foreign royalties were rapidly increasing (from about $15,000 in 1975 to almost $90,000 in 1982), which put him in a tax bracket that prompted his accountant to suggest that buying a house would be a wise financial move. He wrote that he doubled the mortgage payments each month in order to pay the house off in five years.
