instead harboring bitterness tumultuous solitary childhood bukowski used experiences insights gained position outside advantage
case many reclusive adolescents bukowski early discovered solitude magic word

acne vulgaris dint made young bukowski social loner placed bukowski vantage point talent could make frank observations condemnations humanity without fear losing job excluded clique political faction
ernest fontana aptly noted "because acne bukowski never able look society point view insider
acne literal source alienation disfiguring offensive boils metaphoric equivalents bukowski's writing expresses offensive `acned' reality los angeles working sub working class life without stylistic ointment clothing"
convinced almost outset hopelessness humanity lasting friendship largely rejected goals strive
instead found solace alcohol
"getting drunk good" bukowski says ham rye
"i decided would always like getting drunk
took away obvious maybe could get away obvious often enough become obvious yourself" 189
drinking remaining "unobvious" thus became bukowski's vocation started writing seriously around 1960 drinking remaining "unobvious" writing vocations remain day

gerald locklin suggested bukowski's "flouting conventions proprieties `bourgeois' literature" repels readers america
"where english speaking countries" locklin continues "could manners become elevated powerful aesthetic criterion first place"
159 unpublished interview carl weissner bukowski's west german translator points "mostly west german critics stress fact he's hugely enjoyable like attitude aloofness unwillingness accepted fold good citizenbut think bukowski expresses something shared lot people unappetizing aspects life willingness sometimes overdo mostly funny way"
bukowski letter author explains european success way "i believe european public open gamble new ways presentation

charles bukowski western writer choice circumstance
chances raised chicago new orleans atlanta new york rather los angeles would writer regions west
unlike many western writers bukowski concerned exploring exploiting traditions west writer like edward abbey would good news discuss american west ever eye toward past immigrants indians unfulfilled ruined promise plenty
ernest fontana noted "exploit rich metaphoric possibilities diverse topography southern california"
los angeles simply place charles bukowski lived life
says london magazine interview 1974 "you live town life get know every street corner
got layout whole land
picture aresince raised la i've always geographical spiritual feeling
i've time learn city

charles bukowski poet
although first publication age twentyfour short story called "20 tanks kasseldon" soon afterwards gave writing ten years "thought way crashing through" london magazine 44 publication large presses slick magazines person wanted describe lesspleasant side reality blunt matteroffact terms
right
ten year hiatus nearfatal bout alcoholism took finally la county general hospital "blood roaring mouth andass" london magazine 45 stomach ulcer began writing poetry submitting poems little magazines
time efforts appreciated
began gradual climb current status highly acclaimed poet history small press america
bukowski's style approach poetry varied surprisingly little thirtyfive years practicing art
first two full length collections poems catches heart hands crucifix death hand parts still available burning water drowning flame illustrate trademark bukowskian qualities present keen ear musical quality natural everyday speech ability infuse significance desperate dreadful moments life others without becoming bathetic sentimental tremendous facility listing juxtaposing details everyday life abstraction either set scene vivify theme artistic distance subjects allows find humor nuggests wisdom even dismal scenario others' propensity narrative poem exploit later books
"the tragedy leaves" first poem burning water drowning flame shows bukowski tightest lyrically
first line "i awakened dryness ferns dead" sets reader abruptly world raped hope promise eliot's first line "gerontion" "here old man dry month"
bukowski's details remain close home alluding mythologies realities downtrodden permanent wasteland much circumstance choice "and empty bottles like bled corpses surrounded uselessness"
poem sets scene soon become familiar bukowski readers stripped hope work seeing less sense struggling average man dying nosayer poem's protagonist remarks upon daily struggles desperate finding comfort finally truths allow understand frustration
received eviction notice landlady poet records encounter walked dark hall landlady stood execrating final sending hell waving fat sweaty arms screaming screaming rent world failed us
final statement poem made without self pity without pity woman matteroffact stance bukowski's artistic distance subject allows
poem's protagonist drawn bukowski distancing commendable
constantly avoids least early poems overstating perceives facts life
first receiving landlady's eviction note "cracked fine undemanding yellowness" instance poet calmly comments upon situation "what needed good comedian ancient style jester jokes upon absurd pain pain absurd exists nothing more" 15
precisely detachment speaker lack overt melodrama early poems lends dramatic quality makes general pronouncements speaker like "pain absurd exists" believable rather pompous
"the life borodin" fine early example bukowski's empathetic abilities practice holding facts qualities lives others instances individuality endurance hardship admirable obvious connection poet evident
bukowski ordinary eulogist
"the tragedy leaves" bukowski's abstinence melodrama overt praise saves poems maudlin obvious bukowski would say
"the life borodin" one also witnesses skillful reliance upon telling facts frees bukowski narrative flatulence
remember bukowski quietly exhorts reader borodin "was chemist wrote music relax house jammed people students artists drunkards bums never knew say no"
bukowski recounts borodin's childlike obsequiousness wife
hints juxtaposition details inner agony produces great art "she told cut nails sing whistle put much lemon tea press spoon symphony #2 minor prince igor steppes central asia could sleep putting piece dark cloth eyes"
telling details borodin's inner struggle balanced perfectly lines stark details insidious persecution receives home
end poem fate expected "in 1887 attended dance medical academy dressed merrymaking costume last seemed exceptionally gay fell floor thought clowning
next time listen borodin remember" emotional impact poem diminished
many empathetic poems bukowski tell show essentially preach reader
reader left interpret poem although course led carefully selected facts overt authorial presence author's gentle recommendation "remember" 19
"borodin" finally much comment upon art upon borodin
emotional nadir borodin produced powerful symphonies
one note even early stage bukowsi's career theories artistic merit formulated practiced
continues express variously poems present
"art" last poem 1979 book play piano drunk like percussion instrument fingers begin bleed bit articulates one lessons "the life borodin" taught us
reads simply "as spirit wanes form appears" 125
course borodin
yet essential difference poem like "borodin" one like "art" difference colors bukowski's opus much way influential modern poets lawrence stevens moore
taking "borodin" "art" together one see "borodin"like bukowski's empathetic poemsis illustrative poetic theory "art" explanatory
bukowski uses poetry like lawrence many pansies like stevens "of modern poetry" many others like moore "poetry" essentially explain method message illustrative poems
whether necessity open debate
generally illustrative poems always better accepted critically allow degree reader participation explanatory declarative poems prevent
show rather tell
pansies example lawrence's critically denounced poems stevens' "of modern poetry" moore's "poetry" appear anthologies generally students compare "statements" practice evident poets' betterrespected poems
"art" may someday placed anthologies reason
point wish make however bukowski contrary critics would readers believe conscious craftsman ideology well developed many respected poets
bukowski often said south bay interview 1981 "genius ability say profound thing simple way" 33
one could argue implications philosophythat saying something "simple" way also entails said brieflyare make bukowski first poet second writer fiction
would doubt agree "i mean make poetry holy" says south bay
"but #1 play muchthere's little intensity poem say shorter space" 33
definitions "shorter space" however vary
many bukowski's story narrative poems written outset brought criticism readers used artificially tight poetically conventional diction much modernist poetry run pages pages
characteristic bukowski's story poems deceptively easy offthecuff tone replete qualifiers like "somehow" "very" "rather" plenty simple sentences combined almost always coordinating conjunctions
short bukowski reproduces language layman language one might use articulate evening talking friend beer
one earliest examples bukowski's narrative story poems "a literary romance" burning water 21 22
tone immediately distinguishes tighter evocative poems like "the tragedy leaves"
first four lines "i met somehow correspondence poetry magazines began sending sexy poems rape lust mixed minor intellectualism confused somewhat got car drove north" bukowski proceeds north tells story meeting woman sexy poems "a virgin 35 years old" life's work "ten twelve poems" poet read
narrator takes woman boxing matches confirms nothing whatsoever common
leaves "still virgin bad poetess"
poem concludes bukowski's story poems commentary upon tale narrator
time "i think woman kept legs closed 35 years late either love poetry"
frank streetlevel language looseness tone linebreaks seem totally arbitrary along conclusion could easily seen crude punchline raised brows critics continue day
joshua kessler reviewing parnassus 1973 called bukowski's poetry "flat stuff without one insight without one flareup language without interesting emotion even attempt devise poem structured conducive emotion 230
hayden carruth writing harper's magazine 1975 contended "whether charles bukowski's `poems' actually poems open legitimate debate even loosening ideas poetic form occurred past ten fifteen years"
even robert peters one first serious critics write sympathetically bukowski laments "tiresome loquaciousness" 28 saw recent development bukowski's poetry article margins 1975 peters charged poems moved "narrative prose cut less projectively boozy breathgroups
nothing much interest poetically catches ear" 28
true later books especially dangling tournefortia 1981 bukowski turns often narrative poem
"a literary romance" taken first fulllength book poetry illustrates bukowski practiced kind poem outset
kind poem shows starkest break tenets modern poetry seem large part critics bukowski adhere naturally cause consternation
furthermore quotations amply demonstrate deciding whether narratives "a literary romance" categorized poetry whether emotive "interesting" critics invariably failed define terms upon arguments rest
assume condemning abstractions prop argumentsie constitutes "emotion" "interest" indeed "poetry" itselfare universal givens
fact universal givens
indeed pointing "our ideas poetic form" loosened considerably last fifteen years hayden carruth unwittingly alludes shaky foundations upon toooften unspoken criteria rest
anything else charles bukowski's narrative poetry reminded literary public manmade notions "good" vs "bad" poetry
occurred much disappointment many literary critics professors english course stake able "profess" quality profess standards preside
occurred hand much delight thousands readers writers previously soured theoretical opaque allusive qualities much serious literature bukowski
countless little magazines present day literally filled poets originally inspired loosening poetry received bukowski's hands
bukowski write serious literature doubt consider questions class sex relations questions conformity rebellion questions constitutes bravery cowardice love death serious nature
executes poems exploring themes satisfaction arbiters taste attested appearance widelyused collegelevel anthologies norton anthology poetry geography poets
theses dissertations written bukowski one scholarly journal devoted half issue work academic articles bukowski appearing learned journals ever greater frequency around world
