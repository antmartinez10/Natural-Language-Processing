better worse bukowski one authors don’t easily forget ignore
people ambivalent
enjoyed reading bukowski since picked south north california high desert town joshua tree 20 years ago read entire thing without moving ratty old couch slouched
could say became fan day
bukowski died 1994 ridiculously prolific poet publisher black sparrow press continued release “new” poetry collections 15 years death
sounds like sweet deal doesn’t
seemingly endless stream new books popular poet
would read posthumous books couldn’t help feeling little
reading could give distinct uneasy feeling maybe bukowski lost written stuff
quality work began slip point forget moment books published order poems written
thankfully access lot bukowski’s poem manuscripts lot uncollected work bukowski forum
funny thing happens start compare manuscripts literary magazine publications posthumous black sparrow books see lot things changed
better
posthumous collections black sparrow publisher john martin made changes majority bukowski’s poems
damaging changes run counter everything bukowski represented
wholesale removal references drinking drugs sex madness
changes completely alter meaning manuscripts
changes don’t even begin make sense
feels like nothing short gleeful unrepentant vandalism destruction
know you’re thinking “yeah dummy that’s editors do” martin make changes bukowski’s work bukowski alive complain
waited bukowski safely ground pranced sunshine like cute little baby bear hibernation commenced shit poems
might say that’s cowardly move wait artist dies start destroying work would agree
bring subject among certain crowd bristle
become defensive martin downright antagonistic toward list many ways wonderful man veritable saint would believe
weep wail “why trying drag name mud
course i’m dragging name mud i’m merely pointing bringing light giving opinion actions
opinion martin done nothing short literary crime
martin soon dead quickly forgotten legacy destruction live
100 years people still picking bukowski books first time even though won’t know care martin good chance suffering negative impact much bukowski’s work
impact felt forever half bukowski’s available poetry collections
didn’t invent create legacy mr martin
others make point it’s possible wasn’t martin responsible changes
indeed bukowski angrily complained changes martin made novel women martin blamed “lazy typists” yes really said
according person typeset books laziness sloppiness involved
course one would tolerate thing professional typesetter professional publishing house
martin remove changes women publish revised second printing
read original first edition one martin’s changes amateur creative writing class stink posthumous poems
come recognize stink john martin’s hand
see prime example “the stink” end post
words removed red boxes words added green boxes
decide whether changes make poem better
here’s thing whether intentionally simply allowed happen due extreme negligence doesn’t even matter
editor
responsibility final product lies
don’t pretend know thinking scribbled inane flowery craplanguage bukowski’s manuscripts chopped away guts things red pencil
others spoken noted tendency downplay inaccuracies mistakes books unimportant
wave hand saint john officially dismissed concerns
tragic
someone simultaneously careless willfully destructive deface much work one 20th century’s influential poets one thinks matters believe nothing done
it’s true nothing done books something done
something letting people know posthumous poetry collections tainted read mind
honestly don’t think read know that’s unrealistic here’s instead
make
i’m sticking books published bukowski’s lifetime manuscripts literary magazines published without castrating
convenience edification list bukowski’s poetry collections divided two groups
first group bukowski poems read enjoy bask wonderfulness
second group john martin poems
don’t read second group help
john martin shitty poet
poetry collections published bukowski’s lifetime remain mostly unmolested days run away like wild horses hills mockingbird wish luck burning water drowning flame love dog hell play piano drunk like percussion instrument fingers begin bleed bit dangling tournefortia war time get alone times makes sense roominghouse madrigals septuagenarian stew last night earth poems dirty dozen posthumous black sparrowecco books avoided betting muse bone palace ballet matters well walk fire open night night torn mad footsteps sifting madness word line way flash lightning behind mountain slouching toward nirvana come
people look like flowers last pleasures damned continual condition don’t buy don’t read already throw yard gophers weasels tear use make nests
update clarify john martin edits ended continual condition recent posthumous poetry collections seek
collections edited abel debritto used original sources manuscripts early magazine appearances impose “creative editing” poems
they’re worth reading writing cats love essential bukowski poetry anthology previously published poems storm living dead article bukowski’s poetry also noted posthumous short story collections city lights books faithful bukowski wrote well worth time portions winestained notebook absence hero notes dirty old man bell tolls one mathematics breath way writers writing here’s comparison promised earlier

im laughing little also reply mike says june 24 2013 711 pm think “why” martin lived bukowski’s shadow long

especially probably felt equally responsible buk’s success degree that’s probably true
martin pretty good publisher one denying
made good money “collectibles” everything else martin promote man
built webb’s martin jumped right starters letter included inside cover terror street agony way
either martin bukowski wanted stick blade maybe
truth gypsy lou jon responsibility commitment needed securely handle buk’s career
martin buk knew
buk didn’t know someday would get blade crotch martin knew could longer fight back
reply michael phillips says june 24 2013 802 pm could argue bukowski’s work ethic responsible success publisher
black sparrow helped city lights helped
didn’t buy house san pedro bmws black sparrow money
bought foreign royalties far outweighed domestic royalties
say martin nothing making bukowski widely known lot undeniable
bukowski offers larger publishers turned sense loyalty martin
article describes exactly martin ultimately repaid loyalty
harm negate good

reply drew says january 20 2016 835 pm i’m curious appalling overstepping bullshit limited posthumous books
really hope hasn’t happened newer editions older books
it’s posthumous books i’m still relieved buk put much work alive still plenty work dive
i’ll always give martin respect taking chance bukowski good
far understand buk made martin’s publishing career
pretty much went came top
thing coming light would seem bukowski real integrity character didn’t take advantage martin far know i’m still curious state mind rationalization martin weird thing
“bowdlerize” something usually remove unseemly content censorship capacity feel uncomfortable offended feel content morally unsound
martin didn’t flinch publish buk’s raw dirty lowlife poetry
maybe didn’t balls censor buk alive knew could likely make good investment
much time proven writing censor
doesn’t make sense
feel strange jealousy writing
publishing legendary writer alone wasn’t enough martin felt could almost cheat way writing “great” poetry putting influence hide guise “editing” isn’t editing really like said molestation insecure man went technical overseer facilitator selfappointed judge executioner
don’t know really interests psychological sense
greed deep running rationalization little personal masturbatory injection famous poets work get
pisses
bukowski would disgusted
reply mjpinla says january 20 2016 1146 pm later current printings old books fine weren’t changed
“why” there’s answer
might able explain away martin removing references drinking drugs assuming christian “scientist”
way explain vast majority changes assume understand john martin thinks you’re idiot need bukowski writing explained
seems believe applying best junior college writing class skills work way
becomes apparent making lot comparisons john martin understand bukowski’s poetry
reply aw says august 30 2016 226 pm muse compromised since came 96
thanks
reply michael phillips says august 30 2016 354 pm betting muse mostly untouched
compared collections came anyway
reply alec says january 19 2017 715 would poems 2002when martin retired okay read
reply michael phillips says january 19 2017 1249 pm anything okay read aware tampered wasn’t
martin retire 2002 continued edit bukowski’s poetry collections 2009 you’d better served avoid books list article
hope horizon
plans underway reissue posthumous collections restoring work bukowski wrote
may take years complete titles restored eventually
reply keith mahone says march 16 2017 523 find surpassingly bizarre many bukowski fans like cult worshiping cult leader uncritically
bukowski sloppy writer made terrible mistakes plain messes
thing endears many people whether know personality apart consideration writing
life charming trainwreck
reading narcissistic spew get follow drunk around get “slice life” insight world one would see without someone like ranting raving
wish many people actually write poetry would examine discuss work critically
martin’s worst crime far i’m concerned alive published bunch trash sell paper
reading insist sixty percent wrote unsuitable publication
wellcrafted poems hello
didn’t craft anything
work haunted low selfesteem overcompensatory egotistical drunken bullshitter narcissismselfloathing
work obsessively autobiographical
places company great writers actually knew unlike
etc
think greatest appeal willing make spectacle
drunken lecher poet seems many fans attracted drunken debauchery assume poetry work genius
could undertake line line word word analysis work show poorlyread selfobsessed drunk typing
would dismiss joined cult drunk kool aid
fourth major american poet along frost cummings collins
boil writing twenty percent published supervision it’s good enough land spot
grade curve mess
people say prolific that’s easy explain kept charging forward poets would hang onto stuff consider revise discard etc
published trash that’s insult readers forcing search haystack find needles
great tragedy b’s poetry muuch expense less work crafted polished excellent
i’d like add read b’s poetry fiction publishing quality began read stuff published posthumously immediately recognized scam
read slouching toward nirvana resolved buy none trash published died first martin selfishly published two three terrible pieces every decent specimen sell paper stretch page count alive
defied reasoning stuff held back publication could good
add overwhelming urge many publishers try cash someone’s fame abusing readers everything find wastepaper baskets around home deceased proves much temptation hack like martin resist
reply michael phillips says december 2017 814 could undertake line line word word analysis work show poorlyread selfobsessed drunk typing
suspect anyone would entertain idea “undertak[ing] line line word word analysis” anything would find fault since that’s usually purpose undertaking undertaken bloodless undertakers
world full people criticize bukowski’s writing spent lot time family’s money educated along comes ugly drunken common laborer couldn’t even finish community college yet write circles around
fills limp academic anger reveals “criticism” course keith mahone people
you’re different
reply guy ryan harrelson says july 19 2019 517 outstanding response
sincerely impressed vicariously entertained
reply cary bertoncini says may 2017 840 pm emily dickinson’s poems suffered similar treatment argument could probably made many famous examples billy budd sailor melville among
annoying perhaps even abhorrent many us absolutely without precedent
dickinson’s case later versions truer originals later came
possible bukowski’s work
reply john smith says may 2017 518 moby dick heavily rewritten british first edition
specific reasons sexual references religious etc
looking martin changes one hard pressed understand motive
he’s censoring really
reminds old boss used rewrite everything wrote could feel better writing chops
reply michael phillips says may 2017 1211 pm he’s censoring really
would call removing references drinking drugs insanity it’s censoring
reply michael phillips says may 2017 1217 pm absolutely without precedent
say unprecedented
i’m sure people feel compelled keep making nonpoint
dickinson’s case later versions truer originals later came
possible bukowski’s work
anything possible isn’t
question likely
answer absolutely
evidence abundant perfectly clear
reply chrisjarmick says may 2017 1110 wish possible get attention without coming overly dramatic titles isn’t
perhaps would use something like posthumous backstabbing betrayal



actually important information shared
disturbing way justifies completely blog post title
hope unedited poems released point
maybe there’s path thanks publicity article generate
thanks much writing letting travesty better known
kudos
reply michael phillips says may 2017 1217 pm may happy learn behindthescenes move underway rerelease posthumous titles corrected text additional poems similar way “remastered” music albums marketed

reply aileen says september 2017 131 doesn’t surprise astound sadly single submission post questioned accusation
person swallowed whole allegation appraisal mr martin
wonder speak john
give chance respond
relationship black sparrow press post
reply michael phillips says september 2017 809 single submission post questioned accusation
that’s true i’ll assume didn’t read comments articles
even true would “surprise astound”
perhaps people “swallowed whole” “allegation appraisal mr martin” eyes minds souls feel animosity toward wrongdoing
that’s normal human response isn’t
real question might wouldn’t believe
what’s relationship martin
people know friendly seem spring defense without ever considering possibility may acted way disrespectful destructive
refuse even consider possibility
it’s tough pill “swallow whole” get eventually come grips idea one perfect innocent earth isn’t flat great bearded god sky create rib bone first man
faith aileen know one day see light testify highest mountain top heart full love clear conscience truth revealed

problems became much worse bukowski’s death

reply sinan says may 10 2018 1225 pm hello michael phillips came across blog post searching stuff bukowski well written
wondering ‘on cats’ mentioned one ‘to avoided’ list mentioned
couldn’t exactly understand one ‘changed’ ones
it’s posthumous collection it’s unchanged

got copy yesterday curious thanks advance
reply michael phillips says may 10 2018 210 pm cats edited john martin faithful bukowski’s original manuscripts
thanks i’ll update article make clear
reply jr says august 16 2018 233 pm could tell stories guy john martin basically lucked bukowski never even really got writing article clearly reveals
i’ve heard people know martin two friends proudly bragged writing bukowski’s work
john martin un named publisher fact introduction written terry zwigoff second edition book line
robert crumb painted cover book he’d finished illustrating “the captain lunch” ‘97 black sparrow
crumb good friends since painted three covers published books biggest supporter
knew bukowski martin
crumb zwigoff took martin dinner pushed publish line ‘98 agreed
martin called crumb terry’s house sf chickened next day saying afraid black sparrow would get sued crumb wrote saying horse shit cop letter still rc 400 pages letters
crumb took ron turner last gasp republished 2000 crumb terry also gave john martin manuscript auto bio novelmemoir “finding cure cancer”
martin wrote called phone almost immediately got huge fight
basically told “too much drug use book” said “especially cocaine” laugh mentioned times drug alcohol bukowski’s books drugs guy started yelling alcohol different drug shit flipped
also said though “great dialogue tone harsh
bukowski humor writing” couldn’t believe man published bukowski saying things tried explain actually lot humor stuff exactly robert crumb thinks it’s funny
martin goes long tirade putting crumb says “let tell something new friend crumb thinks funny
driving car crumb one day…” told long derogatory story robert won’t repeat
john martin struck completely phony nut
martin must felt guilty though sent couple huge boxes black sparrow books twice letters never wrote back
book rejected
got published year liveright ww norton new title “bad jobs poor decisions” fuck john martin
bukowski always way loyal
jr helton
san antonio texas 2018 reply michael phillips says september 17 2018 1237 pm suppose someone “too loyal” don’t know bukowski ever turned bigger appropriate publisher deference martin
it’s good bear mind real unapologetic rape happened bukowski six feet
happened scale alive think loyalty would tested
would seem exactly martin waited bukowski couldn’t complain begin gutting work
reply uriah says september 17 2018 506 blog ever read actually real value
don’t know many times read bukowski got soft later
read work see films watch interviews know vehemently would stopped writing felt loosing touch
history lesson everyone people change work message lie stood people fact check one come aid gone history meaningless except see example example self servicing rewrites blatant slandering reinterpretation lies
exposing mechanism humanity pissed history away choice power ego exactly quit reading history listen words archeologist directly mouths
humanity fucking traitors self traitors past future words humanities word ain’t worth shit big lies stupid people swallow
came another swallower triumph miracle story self
can’t thank enough can’t praise enough went beyond lies side truth go along majority
already look herd apes come try stop discourage make seem like isn’t important
like eating shit love word slaves pronoun gimps pimped sponsor gun peoples lot life
thank standing tyranny human hubris ego
michael phillips thank
reply michael phillips says september 17 2018 1242 pm humanity fucking traitors can’t say bukowski didn’t warn us one tombstone mess say humanity never beginning
reply astrophil says september 30 2018 815 pm
it’s easy prophet fact like many others say knew
read couple posthumous collections definitely feeling something amiss
wasn’t much usual content different
even sure never thought drinking copulating interesting part work anyway actually example least elision references drinking forms tiny part intervention
rather style rhythm seemed gone downhill
may sound like strange complaint things didn’t seem scan
appeared example lack intermittent outbursts fairly conventional metre view drive powerful lines older work eg
‘what puts blackbird cat’s mouth us say’ ‘thinking they’re toughthinking they’re menbut really closer mother’s titsthan true evaluation existence’ seemed none given sort irrelevant stuffingin mr martin’s editorial practice seems consisted one see
stranger still author insisting felt writing getting better age
lost
lying
grown older dumber
mystery
course quality work properly presented remains seen
case makes whole thing downright mindboggling absolute randomness pointlessness changes shown
one perhaps explain apparently limited ‘bowdlerisartion’ earth would anyone change $40 loss $400 gain track
what’s point
respect mr martin making buk’s career possible first place shame shame inexplicable violation
reply astrophil says october 2018 822 would like add calmer afterthought fairness mr martin already mentioned bukowski fans great lot grateful
although example editing rather outrageous much thorough study many examples would needed demonstrate merely unfortunate isolated instance editorial malpractice
thanks reply michael phillips says october 2018 949 hundreds comparisons done
unfortunate fact example far “isolated instance” beyond doubt systematic consistent rewriting poems posthumous collections
cite one example many 75 manuscripts sifting madness 75 poems rewritten martin collection
read examples see kind conclusion draw httpsbukowskinetcomparisons httpsbukowskiforumcomforumspoemcomparisons53 reply tan geers says october 18 2018 852 pm martin hung neck til dead
right defend hung well
reply james smith says february 26 2019 138 pm last black sparrow volume night torn mad footsteps sense old hank’s still
starting sifting madness… first harpercollinsecco title feels thought work gotten really anodyne spirit completely gone
wonder much sale large mainstream house
reply michael phillips says february 27 2019 1114 sale black sparrow press didn’t really anything changes
martin continued edit collections even sale including continual condition
increase edits started immediately bukowski’s death evident first posthumous collection betting muse
may feel night torn mad footsteps
four years earlier 1997’s bone palace ballet virtually every poem shows evidence destructive tampering
thing night torn mad footsteps
sale company unrelated far issue concerned
harpercollinsecco’s credit linda made aware martin’s destructive editing complained put end editorial involvement
