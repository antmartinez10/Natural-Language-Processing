bukowski replies san francisco beautiful pulsing city full culture diversity
visited summers ago one favorite areas north beach
although outdoor murals sculptures splattered buildings sidewalks definitely played part main reason loved north beach much bookstore called city lights
city lights oasis beatnik generation
poets authors would gather throughout 1950’s 60’s discuss controversial prose banned literature
present day city lights remains safe alternative presents labyrinth books venture
spent several hours wandering stacks trying various genres
eventually came upon sign leading towards poetry section
discovered one alltime favorite poetsauthors charles bukowski
picked collection poems called “the last night earth poems” fell love
throughout charles bukowski’s fifty years writing composed six novels several books short stories dozens collections poetry
overwhelming majority writing overflows disillusionment anger copious amounts alcohol
though bukowski one cynical authors think work continues charm
think due unapologetic realism bukowski injects writing
weariness towards society characteristic beatnik generation though bukowski beatnik
**for information bukowski browse work click
poem “this” illustrates bukowksi’s style well
selfcongratulatory nonsense famous gather applaud seeming greatness wonder real ones giant cave hides deathly talentless bow accolades fools fooled wonder real ones real ones
selfcongratulatory nonsense lasted decades exceptions centuries
dreary absolutely pitiless churns gut powder shackles hope makes little things like pulling shade putting shoes walking street difficult near damnable famous gather applaud seeming greatness fools fooled humanity sick motherfucker
bukowski separates “the little things” physically moving next line one “pulling shade putting shoes walking street” effective interrupts flow words making harder progress
syntactical challenge matches bukowski’s implication simple mundane tasks become difficult one deal “selfcongratulatory nonsense” time
also like bukowski starts second third last stanzas “as” repetition “as” allows reader connect two stanzas compare
“the famous” become “the fools” entry posted passion tagged babcock passion rcl1314 march 26 2014 cara dore
post navigation previous post← dancers among us next post keeping track thoughts “this bukowski” ank5283 april 2014 1100 don’t experience particular poet poetry general matter definitely good job painting good picture man attitude toward work
feel like type thing fits perfectly sanfran beatnik scene picture little bookstore types eclectic classic poetry books
arm5738 april 2014 1036 bookstores like favorite
feel like barnes nobles world really taken
new york friend weeks ago walking back apartment found cutest bookstore
family owned run charming place
spent hour sitting huge comfy chairs reading poetry actually
exactly poetry guru friend wanted buy everything
seems like would loved place
kaylie maines april 2014 1027 high school english class actually small segment bukowski
agree really appreciate unapologetic
throughout reading work always felt calling things way saw
that’s fairly unique poets beatnik era
poetry time seems fraught distress directed “man” feel poets personal stake work
bukowski states piece seems move
cxz5056 april 2014 1002 found great went place filled thousands texts poetry found something personally connected
often find moments new city first time often rewarding
bukowski think yes man cynic however believe words says poem maybe cynical satirical
mjh5696 march 27 2014 1003 way dissect poem really well done
wouldn’t thought use “as” connect two stanzas show fools famous one
enjoy sort writing unapologetic rough truth emerges bukowski’s poems
also enjoy almost entirety poem nuanced slightly subtle last stanza translates dark humor
dag5441 march 27 2014 959 author sound cynical
think great job going overall picture bright beautiful san francisco particular niche poetry citizens san fran present
begs question whether san francisco seems first appearances genre bukowski portrays
food thought…
