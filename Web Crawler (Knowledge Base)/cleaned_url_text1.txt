fortunately eventfully misspent adulthood supplied fund experience rich potential
bukowski's uses admittedly wildly uneven quality best notably various early stories reproduced squalor violence lowlife la dirtiest dirty realism
1970 aged fifty emerging reputation bukowski became fulltime writer
significantly though impressive work still derived preceding period life
mid1970s source worn thin
new material available—bukowski's career minor literary celebrity—carried much less substance strikingly illustrated third novel women fragmentary account life since 1970 little selfaggrandizing catalogue interchangeable sexual encounters

“fooling marie” shows something like old spirit content—a gambler robbed motel room woman picked racetrack—comes right bottom barrel

even book title flatly articulated oxymoron reminiscent men without women winner take nothing alerts reader hemingway presence
bukowskihemingway connection one riddled complex ambivalences
trust brief reading south north might indicate dimensions knot
first reading bukowski's collection evoked thoughts consciously creating parody hemingway style
consider excerpt bukowski's “loneliness” “maybe i'm good sex” said edna “maybe that's i'm alone” took another drink glass
“each us finally alone” said joe
“what mean” “i mean matter well going sexually lovewise day arrives over”1 identical sound simply cadenced american speech bonded conversational syntax created severely limited though far limiting vocabulary archetypal “ordinary joe” likeness hemingway becomes even striking put relationship excerpt hemingway's death afternoon “madam stories continued far enough end death true story teller keeps you”2 however hardboiled hemingway sounded bullfight epic bukowski determined outdo papa
bukowski's sense competition hemingway's talent humorously borrows metaphor hemingway uses describe competitive relationship master fiction writers past
hemingway bragging publisher mock modesty macho abandonment “am man without ambition except champion world fight dr tolstoi 20 round bout know would knock ears mr henry james would thumb first time grabbed hit balls ask referee stop it” 26
bukowski's “class” little author's dream getting boxing ring—literally—with hemingway
course bukowski gleefully celebrates raw powers “i hemingway ropes
fall
time started fall forward straightened another punch
murder
death afternoon” 67
yet reading bukowski transcend parody papa
note turn “class” takes narrator knocks hemingway got dressed ernie regained consciousness
“what hell happened” asked
“you met pretty good man mr hemingway” somebody told
“you're good man papa
nobody wins all” shook hand
“don't blow brains out” 68 even flippancy narrator's last line can't erase sense tender respect rare book bukowski feels papa
“no neck bad hell” story south north hemingway's ghost becomes reanimated duels henry chinaskicumcharles bukowski
one narrator's drunken reveries provides setting imagines hemingway local bar saying “you talk like character early huxley” “i think wrong
i'm desperate” “but” said hemingway “men become intellectuals order desperate” 138 verbal sparring continues naturally narrator wins
bukowski willing let hemingway draw blood fray stab bukowski's roots huxley
despite instances bukowski triumphing hemingway one can't help note bukowski's humility hemingway genius “this killed dylan thomas” thinly disguised account bukowski's first public reading san francisco “we walk across street italian cafe

examples south north hemingway directly evoked bukowski's stories
however overwhelming machismo sensibility hemingway constantly punctuates bukowski's fictions
“a man” bukowski story states machismo starkly “i'm man baby understand that” “i know man george” “here look muscles” george stood flexed arms
“beautiful eh baby
look muscle
feel
feel it” constance felt one arms

“yes beautiful body george” “i'm man
i'm dishwasher i'm man real man” 63 character's assertion masculine dignity spite lowness occupation another factor links bukowski hemingway
authors assert masculine dignity necessary riteofpassage technique order survive integrally within unjust emasculating socioeconomic system
ruthless drive “act like man” hemingway bukowski characters share leads distrust authors political solutions
hemingway writes letter paul romaine i'm goddamned patriot swing left right
would soon machine gun left right center political bastards work living
110 bukowski voices similar disgust “politics” describes disillusionment student politics la city college assumes prohitler stance fellow students simply bored pious unfelt antifascist platitudes
bukowski's cynicism countercultural protest left brutally symbolized red ants crawling tattered remains abandoned protest flag “something viet cong flag” characters bukowski hemingway rugged individualists defy utopian schemes ideologues
male character armor held firm swaggering boastfulness assures survival
bukowski characteristically develops stance “bop bop curtain” “there public funds playgrounds

criticism perhaps even ruthless bukowski's case
women characters south north little sexual fetishes replaceable mute mannequins believe narrator “love $1750” yet hemingway bukowski exhibit boyishly fetching worshipful sentimentality toward women stories

[in following essay harrison traces development bukowski's short fiction]
started short story starving little rooms around country drinking much cheap wine i'd mail things atlantic monthly harpers came back tore
used write 10 stories week
i'd write stories drink much possible1 bukowski published two hundred short stories
began almost compulsively writing short stories early adolescence broke print story magazine mid1940s2 several additional publications abandoned form almost twenty years
although returned chapbook publications mid1960s impetus enduring return offer column write virtually anything wanted john bryan founder los angeles alternative paper open city3 columns subsequently included opinion pieces nonfiction sketches fiction often exclusively autobiographical nature appeared context bukowski's “fiction took place alongside coverage student unrest new left black power civic police corruption draft resistance drug information adverts sexual contacts services”4 fiction two sorts narratives sometimes fantastic nature fictional reworkings autobiographical material5 bukowski continued writing stories whole variation quality developed evolved short story writer point two recent collections hot water music 1983 septuagenarian stew 1990 contain best stories
although serious short story production began late 1960s best stories written 1980s bukowski's acknowledged influences american writers 1920s 1930s anderson hemingway saroyan fante mccullers6 terms contemporaries similarity work raymond carver striking difference acceptance suggests significant differences work7 poetry noticeable change appeared stories 1970s evident third collection south north
bukowski began achieve distance material formal evidence increased use third person
another indication fact content stories even written first person became less frequently autobiographical
objective point view increasingly distanced stance towards characters material continued two subsequent collections bukowski uses third person even frequently indeed recent collection threequarters stories thirdperson narratives8 remarkable difference quality style first two collections two recent collections south north forming transition
essay briefly looks early stories provide background discussion bukowski's achievement later ones
however first two collections remain important several reasons prose basis bukowski first achieved broader american audience well international reputation long time influenced bukowski's reception abroad collections redeeming moments eg “frozen man” essays notes prison realism “doing time public enemy
1” hemingwayesque amoralism “all pussy want” erections finally much material reused later novels differing treatments material allow us see bukowski's progress writer
surprisingly light bukowski's early success germany one comprehensive scholarly evaluations early stories undertaken two german scholars armin geraths kurt herget9 although analysis stories' shortcomings somewhat misguided suffers ignoring collection south north intelligent useful attempt come grips bukowski's early prose provides basis discussing later stories
geraths' herget's criticisms fall three areas language subject matter ideas
write bukowski's language without intellectual pretension
trivial language everyday life limited vocabulary enriched lavish use argot
linguistic intellectual structures great simplicity
subjects often appear banal
insights gathered stories seldom go beyond level tired clichés
176 one exception accurate generalization reproaches limited simplicity language manifested limited vocabulary everyday speech integral part many hemingway's best stories
argot except stories dealing horseracing evidence rather emphatic colloquialism probably authors remarking upon something hallmark american fiction since late nineteenth century makes little sense censure bukowski
bukowski's linguistic structures simpler hemingway's much simpler anderson's saroyan's
given “pragmatic” american tradition emphasis experience distrust intellectualism primary trait 20th century american literature one example found concise expression williams' statement paterson “no ideas things” bukowski's position resultant stories unusual respect
also borne mind ideas presented number ways bukowski's presentation often hides behind apparently trivial content
authors note one element early stories though overemphasize continued appear short fiction never part novels orbit subject proves completely ordinary trivial banal
yet element sensational lies hidden everything one always proceeding exceptional ordinary
point bukowski places simple tactic
unusual sensational modulate seamlessly familiar common thereby producing banalization incredible time familiar given new dimension
181 truth suffers greatly attempt bring sixtyfour stories collected erections one rubric
also accurately note failing early stories bukowski subsequently overcome lack ability abstract meagerly developed conceptual language
always point course narration summary imposes flatness thought becomes revealed cliché complex facts simplified
also sentimental streak manner dime novel often makes presence felt
194 although premises false judgments sometimes questionable particular criticism valid useful analyzing difference early late stories
issues “a low level abstraction” clichéd content lends stories formulaic quality tendency towards sentimentality legitimate criticisms bukowski's early stories
status “the sensational” also underwent change early late stories
discussion issues reveals recent stories represent significant advance first two collections even retain transform certain “suspect” elements
bukowski able distance material increased control language noticeable respect diction sentence structure
handling plot also became assured
clearest measure increased confidence however increased use third person
longer need “vouch” authenticity material writing first person
end reflects confidence nature material even though content often remained ordinary sensational never completely disappeared
indeed part bukowski's achievement
perhaps nowhere increased distance obvious bukowski's treatment relations sexes particularly explicit descriptions sex topic prominent stories novels exception women
“absence ability abstract meagerly developed conceptual language” resulted formulaic quality respect action motivation well clichéd language
although number stories contain explicit descriptions sex remained erections hot water music treatment changed
none bukowski's stories seems pornographic sense sexually arousing sexual scenes early stories repetitious simplistic rather went crazy began clawing dress—what
saw bit underslip panties ripped dress top ripped brassiere got tit
got tit
fat
kissed sucked thing
twisted hand screamed pushed mouth gagging screams
ripped dress back—nylon nylon legs knees flesh
picked chair ripped chickenshit panties rammed home
“andre” said
“oh andre” looked guy watching us jacking chair
“the day talked james thurber” 14546 close actually language pulp fiction
brutally formulaic inflated clichéd “we kissed
cass crying without sound
could feel tears
long black hair lay behind like flag death
enjoined made slow sombre wonderful love” “the beautiful woman town” “rammed home” one hand “enjoined” sentimental clichéd
seem written one eye clearly audience
later stories descriptions sex though equally explicit indeed sometimes even become mediated
several stories sex reported first hand one particularly artful passage almost proleptic
important sex later stories often funny
true earlier stories violence scene quoted
“have read pirandello” hot water music narrator speaking phone woman never met thinking renting room tells performs cunnilingus “how begin” “with brush stroke lightly” “of course course
begin” “yes well techniques …” “what techniques” “the first touch usually dulls sensitivity area can't return effectiveness” “what hell mean” “you know mean” “you're making hot” “this clinical” “this sexual
making hot” “i know else say” “what man then” “you let enjoyment guide exploration
different time” “what mean” “i mean sometimes bit gross sometimes tender whichever way feel” “tell me” “well everything ends clit” “say word again” “what” “clit” “clit clit clit …” “do suck
nibble it” “of course” “you're making hot” “sorry” “you master bedroom
like privacy” “like told you” “tell clit” “all clits different” “it's private right
they're building retaining wall
they'll couple days
like here” 6465 playful humor replaces violence whatever coarse humor exists earlier story
fact reading phone conversation somewhat distanced interspersing ordinary even “trivial” details slight reluctance narrator go detailed description act convey impression author control material explicit sexual description opposite formulaic neither brutal sentimental
yet irony description explicit actual fictional act described
irony worlds away unmediated physicality earlier stories
sexual arousal bukowski saying one's head merely physical either10 narrator's statement “it's different time” might well taken recognition formulaic clichéd—in sphere—are hindrances creativity variety change—perhaps even unexpected—are pleasurable
one final point overlooked whole passage concerns woman's pleasure man best provide
far cry situation number early stories women function objects man's gratification
would hard imagine character stories averring “everything ends clit”11 geraths herget characterized early stories “naive” “elementary” “spontaneous” valid good deal writing notes erections although also noted many stories moments overcome failings
last element however “spontaneity”—a lack mediation—that resulted stories' problematic aspects
repetitive sometimes sloppy writing result aesthetic credo marred fair amount bukowski's early work especially prose
bukowski appearance spontaneity something valued important seem “literary” result described julian smith deliberately disorderly syntax “spontaneous” typewriterese creates effect radical difference smoother literary writing
bukowski flavors lexical stew notes misspellings ungrammatical constructions sentences verbs repetitions split infinitives much slang swearing sexual innuendo linguistic ambiguities enable splice sexuality violence nastiness humor
deliberately leaving text sort grammatical confusions common speech usually suppressed written english bukowski indicating wants align writing spoken rather written conventions
57 writing however “literary” “natural” either
repetitions redundancies choices notquiteright word mannered consciously literary prose though different way important difference bukowski
writing calls attention much writing reacts “loaded” roland barthes' words “with spectacular signs fabrication”12 one result stance “banality” writing smith wrote though viewing positively involved “no recourse intellectual concepts” one best earlier stories “a couple winos” collection south north 1973
suggests something bukowski later succeed achieving consistently well manifesting weaknesses flaw early stories
firstperson narrator drifter 20s events described story take place days california desert
older man hired stack discarded railroad ties someone later going resell drove along talking truck rocking back forth
nothinq dust dust desert
guy much face much anything
sometimes small people stay place long time achieve minor prestige power
truck hiring
sometimes go along
44 repetitions second third sentences weaknesses paragraph adding nothing descriptions probably deriving author's feeling description lacking way
fourth sentence effective assured content present minor insight world ordinary work
something might find factotum example
last two sentences paragraph also effective unvarnished representations fact life
bukowski's description job's function broader context effective summary reaches criticism uneconomic practice every railroad company would rip old ties replace new ones
left old ties laying beside tracks
much wrong old ties railroad left laying around burkhart guys like us stack ricks toted truck sold
45 repetition “left laying” seems justified effectively even poetically emphasizing point narrator making
even effective description feelings work arouses like impossible job got tired wanted quit got tired forgot quit minutes move lived forever inside one minute hope trapped dumb quit nowhere go quit
45 phrases like “the minutes move lived forever inside one minute” impressive extraordinarily vivid representations feelings created work though repetition adds weight rhythm develops description
ultimately bukowski yet quite enough confidence simple force experience
clear ending “a couple winos” nights earlier found got cold slivers hand began throb
could feel one
began get cold
can't say hated world men women felt certain disgust separated craftsmen tradesmen liars lovers decades later feel disgust
course one man's story one man's view reality
keep reading maybe next story happier
hope
48 would better end paragraph story period “disgust” every additional thought point weakens force come first condemning humanity heightening condemnation taking back apologizing
endings difficult seems particularly injurious early stories poems bukowski's feeling somehow description experience enough almost bukowski appreciate force experiences said world
subsequently bukowski never questioned validity experience authority individual experience became powerful increasing objectivity depiction
later stories bukowski replaced “lexical stew” illusion ordinary discourse achieved formal structural techniques
one reviewer perceptively noted principal character mediated actions manner verbal expression
bukowski's dialogues merely result good ear specific scene
rather purposive abruptness concise diction consequence formal intention13 increase conceptualization evident ability summarize individual situation—one form ability abstract—in paragraph two “head job” widow finds interest pianoplaying drinking little else she'd two lovers since death husband affairs desultory shortlived
men seemed lack magic bad lovers sexually spiritually
interests seemed center new cars sports television
least harry late husband taken occasional symphony
god knows mehta bad conductor beat watching laverne shirley
margie simply resigned existence without male animal
lived quiet life piano brandy scotch
sun went needed piano much chopin scotch andor brandy
would begin light one cigarette another evening arrived
113 cliché replaced nuanced language capable effectively reflecting mood
indeed narrative passage times employs free indirect speech particularly effective way get character's mind retaining objective tone technique bukowski rarely used early stories
sentences “men seemed lack magic” “god knows mehta bad conductor beat watching laverne shirley” entered another person's mind assumption thing marked change bukowski's earlier views
easiest technique use requires ability create differentiated characters
also sign bukowski's increasing skill technical confidence uses effectively
bukowski developed apparently unexceptional prose call attention though clearly artistic prose many conjunctions poetic repetitions
subtle changes context ironic humor sexual descriptions preclude suggestion formulaic
“banality” events described differ much subjects early stories longer “naive” “spontaneous” presentation
stories pared well
hot water music almost third shorter stories erections
titles shorter well less “flippant” often ironic “head job” ideas bukowski wants impart imparted obliquely concise description short effective dialogue marked contrast dialogues earlier stories
general loose sprawling awkwardness early stories longer evident
bukowski remarked “my style keeps adjusting changing life
…”14 sensational also handled better toned domesticated instances quite literally
illustrated one frequent manifestations theme human mutilation
appears “the fuck machine” erections “maja thurup” south north
latter bukowski begun put extreme events quotidian context—less removed middleclass readers' milieu—and way sharpened humor depiction making situations credible
“decline fall” hot water music perfected type story placing depravity everyday context “ordinary” people
bukowski uses successfully geraths herget identified one strategy stories though questioned efficacy “one always proceeding exceptional ordinary
unusual sensational modulate seamlessly familiar common thereby producing banalization incredible” though technique effect far successful later stories bukowski made characters far less marginal selfconsciously alienated less eccentric senses word
time bukowski downshifted incredible improbable
whereas early stories characters private worlds indeed even included mad german scientist “fuck machine” characters longer marginal middle american bukowski uses minor inconsequential details increase credibility events
“decline fall” mel telling bartender unusual experience had15 visited couple knows playing cards watching football game man tells wife likes sex somebody else watching
mel reply couple proceed sex “he picks kisses throws couch
he's kissing ripping clothes
he's got panties he's work
he's looking underneath see i'm watching
sees i'm watching starts squirming like mad snake
really go finish gets goes bathroom al goes kitchen beers
‘thanks’ says comes ‘you big help’” “then happens” asked barkeep
“well rams finally scored lot noise tv comes bathroom goes kitchen
…” 58 dinner “then erica calls us breakfast nook table set sit
smells good—a roast
slices pineapple top
looks like upper shank see almost looks like knee
‘al’ say ‘that thing really looks like human leg knee up’ ‘that’ says al ‘is exactly is’” mel thinks al joking says “great cut nice slice” “‘listen al’ said ‘this really bad
it’ ‘it's like told mel’ answers ‘it's human leg upper flank
14yearold boy found hitchhiking hollywood boulevard
took fed watched erica thing three four days got tired slaughtered cleaned innards ran garbage disposal dropped freezer
hell lot better chicken though actually prefer porterhouse’” “he said that” asked barkeep reaching another drink bar
“he said that” answered mel
“give another beer” barkeep gave mel another beer
mel said “well still thought joking know said ‘all right let see freezer’ al says ‘sure—over here’ pulls back lid there's torso leg half two arms head
chopped like
looks sanitary still look good
head looking us eyes open blue tongue sticking head—it's frozen lower lip
“‘jesus christ al’ say ‘you're killer—this unbelievable sickening’ “‘grow up’ says ‘they kill people millions wars give medals
half people world gonna starve death sit around watch tv’” 5960 mel tries leave prevented al whose wife forces upon “the rams still tv
step back door wife runs grabs starts kiss
know
powerfully built woman
knows nurses' tricks” 60
mel erica sex al watches
afterwards mel drinks beer smokes cigarette leaves
carl bartender upset mel go police “the way look accessory murder” “but got thinking carl people really seem bad people
i've seen people disliked lot never killed anything
know really confusing
even think guy freezer kind big frozen rabbit …” 61 carl pulls gun mel call police
mel says making whole thing “it bullshit” carl unconvinced “you mean told me” “yeah bullshit
one big joke
sucked
put gun away pour us scotch water” “that story bullshit” “i told was” “that bullshit story—there much detail
nobody tells story like
that's joke
nobody jokes way” “i tell bullshit carl” “there's way believe that” carl reaches phone mel hits beer bottle picked luger aimed carefully squeezed trigger put gun brown paper bag jumped back bar walked entrance boulevard
parking meter read “expired” front car ticket
got drove
61 story's power stems deadpan humor detailed realism treats sensational content
carl says “there much detail” story true
humor results mel's absurd literalness
mel replies carl's question “well happened” “well rams scored” see one type mindset
literal sense rams scoring happened next course carl mean question literally
yet rams scoring mind focussed concrete would see mind incapable viewing “the big picture” directly relates another level story also suggested title literalness counterpoints
beginning story mel tells bartender “al says something reagan something unemployment can't respond bores
see give damn country rotten long make it” 5758
people exception carl significantly bartender profoundly asocial individuals
reagan unemployment even starvation meaning football game something meaningless except arbitrary terms
concept social world disappeared lives logically must private world
paradoxically underlined making private relations sex public
end story mel relieved ticketed—this shot someone
identification gun luger perhaps also suggests nazi mentality complete absence remorse murderers
yet reaction humorous much way bukowski's sexual chauvinism humorous implicates us
humor based fact characters completely narrow private world al says “half people world gonna starve death sit around watch tv” getting little close comfort
story operates number levels disturbing
solidifies disturbance ending
one sense ending problematic heaps one extraordinary killing another
given various mass murders serial killings instances child abuse plain perverse murders last two decades cannot say single instance cannibalism implausible
strains credulity course al erica casually reveal crime friend particularly close friend that16 mel kills carl making two murders within confines fourandonehalf page story—while unbelievable—begins push events towards incredible
yet story ended earlier mel kills carl mel's recanting saying “it's bullshit” allowing ambiguity would detract bukowski's point rests “truth” events within context story
story says things happen people exist bukowski message made palatable humor
mel's coolness—now killer—is essential bukowski's point somewhat tritely summarized “banality evil” ending ambiguous story's morality would vanish
one hand lack ambiguity may make story seem little “retro” humor banality lend postmodern touch
one final point interest
“decline fall” “the day talked james thurber” quoted scenes two people sex third watches
scene “decline fall” far effective two reasons
first bukowski placed context relates aspects story rather subtle fashion also increased distance reader event story told third person omniscient narrator yet within narration story told one characters long passages direct speech times quotes speech others
way effect immediacy objectivity distance provides
would simplistic say bukowski's growing preference third person stories produced better stories
decision change narrative techniques come result deeper shifts feeling time though formal change undoubtedly helped crystallize first perhaps somewhat inchoate shift authorial worldview
issue child abuse appears another story hot water music
“some hangover” married couple gwen kevin discussing fact husband may sexually abused children friends drunk party
gwen preparing breakfast
gwen bacon
poured cup coffee
“thanks” “scrambled” “scrambled” “married ten years always say ‘scrambled’” “more amazing always ask” “kevin gets around job
bank need branch manager child molester” “i guess not” “kevin we've got meeting families involved
we've got sit talk thing out” “you sound like scene godfather” “kevin big trouble
there's way getting around
trouble
put toast
push slow pop right something wrong spring” kevin put toast
gwen dished bacon eggs
95 situation though dramatic less sensational “decline fall”17 yet kevin character world little ability put things broader context faulty toaster par possible child abuse
skill story bukowski's delicate balancing humorous interplay husband wife serious nature possible offence
necessary success story
ability hold different elements solution underlies success number stories testifies bukowski's aesthetic distance material
would forcing say complicit characters yet far removed
indeed child abuser married middleclass martin blanchard “the fiend” alienated loner
ordinariness people stories reflected names mel al carl erica kevin gwen names unmarked possible
bukowski constructed stories way enmeshed solipsistic detail characters
dilemma bukowski's characters confronted early poetry novels respond legitimate demands social world time maintaining one's self ratcheted several notches
question social world
hot water music septuagenarian stew bukowski's stories broaden social horizons
worldview certain scope effectively dramatized without recourse abstract philosophizing actually prominent early stories perhaps owing appearance columns marked use first person
“the death father ii” hot water music “the life bum” bukowski's masterpiece genre septuagenarian stew bukowski redramatizes view solitary nature existence well individual's inextricable connection predatory society
“the death father ii” small masterpiece deals themes examining individual's relationship family history
one sense story coming terms death parent
time three pages contains core bukowski's views authority individual society american dream
story final separation family impossibility separation power personal history
story opens “my mother died year earlier
week father's death stood house alone” hwm 167
narrator story seen father “in time” neighbors know
although parents dead broader social world remains “curtains drew back stood front lawn
began coming houses” “people” “neighbors” rather vague illdefined slightly ominous “they” given bukowski's skill dialogue chinaski's facility speech marked neighbor nellie miller's direct question “are henry” bukowski answer direct speech “i told henry” slightly mocking ironic repetition words nicely reflects distance feels towards people values important father's values
narrator feels ambivalent talking neighbors wants adhere routine forms politeness civility chinaski rarely boorish situations though impositions even physical ones “i bent shut hose” key element becomes uncomfortable physical activity
social world impinged—and thus imposed—on stopped forced politeness direct speech “‘won't come in’ asked” “we sat looked other” narrator give inch “‘you look like father’ ‘yes tell me’” genuinely responding millers
even respond directly quickly whips ball back court “‘he must liked pictures’ ‘yes he’” 168
real motive neighbor's visit becomes clear “i love painting windmill sunset” along chinaski's attempt separating father deadpan comment father's taste art reflected mrs miller's speech
we're left doubt score another neighbor says “oh love frame like picture” “take frame” “but picture” “throw trash” 168 narrator remains passiveaggressive throughout story
ultimate aggression story extends neighbors rope hang actions condemn world convention father's
neighbors pillage house denuding almost everything value
lest shown unrelievedly predatory story lack credibility bukowski gives us one altruistic soul “‘you better save vacuum cleaner henry
use apartment’ ‘all right i'll keep it’” exchange also evidence chinaski's passivity implied author would like us see victimization
reality chinaski control events
something values threatened exerts “leave whiskey” “i'll keep car” tone throughout objective “absence modals words feeling”18 though occasionally judgement passed “passersby coming street even bothering introduce themselves” slight—but often bukowski powerful foregrounded otherwise customary absence—moralizing little effect however one ladies opened cupboard back porch
“what preserved fruits
never able eat these” “all right everybody take
try divide equally” “oh want strawberries” “oh want figs” “oh want marmalade” 169 everybody left remains “the garden hose bed refrigerator stove roll toilet paper” nice list three basic needs provided chinaski leaves house walked outside locked garage door
two small boys came roller skates
stopped locking garage doors
“see man” “yes” “his father died” skated
picked hose turned faucet began water roses
16970 ending muted yet nicely points meaning try can't get rid father
world let us
stylistically “the death father ii” gives us side bukowski became prominent stories hot water music septuagenarian stew part sensibility finds expression hemingwayesque minimalism
respect “the death father ii” something idealtype
stories short focus brief sometimes quite mundane moment someone's life take present larger truths people society
“beer corner bar” perfectly innocuous conversation newspaper story turns near violence “it's dirty world” literally figuratively pedestrian incident escalate violence
thus clear ordinariness content per se marred number early stories least part bukowski's defensive stance
one basis shift style confidence material confidence lack discipline earlier stories undermined rather supported
hot water music published bukowski 63 might well stayed form mastered serving well
yet stories recent collection septuagenarian stew show continued changes supporting said relationship style life19 collection bukowski continued to—not much develop as—evolve
hot water music brought one kind short story culmination short controlled offhand
septuagenarian stew bukowski expands view
stories carefully constructed even cases eg “the vengeance damned” consciously dramatize political idea
indeed story bukowski first time fiction presented truly collective subject attempting radically change existing social relations never mind bunch winos standins return consumerist repressed
collective subject appeared poems 1980s continued 1990s
thus respect subject matter form ideology bukowski's short stories continued change significant ways something true poetry less true novels
stories septuagenarian stew average somewhat longer preceding collections important fact bukowski written individual stories longer anything attempted twenty years
long stories early collections reflected bukowski's antiformalist ethos period
stories “confessions man insane enough live beasts” “all assholes world mine” “the birth life death underground newspaper” formal dynamic picaresque subjectivity
especially true “confessions man insane enough live beasts” dry run autobiographical novels
two stories focus narrowly specific episodes thus unified unlike “the life bum” motivated attempt limit scope possible meaning
important though fact late story bukowski written usual themes differently achieved something different made banal trivial representative indeed meaningful
bukowski approaches beckett joyce latter privileging ordinary life former moments beckett uses repetitive simplified syntactic structures highlight banal routine example narrator molloy tries get grasp things simplification syntax went upstairs

127 something reductionism syntax “the life bum” though bukowski's language remains referential
way certain passages mahler prefigure atonal music yet remaining within traditional key structure classical music bukowski times verges minimalism without much alteration could emphasize linguistic structures extent become subject story
referentiality form plot focus objects everyday existence strong anchor form melody mahler

ss 56 ellipsis original
already clear bukowski presenting one cornerstones worldview—the overwhelmingly tedious routine much passes life—in prosaic somewhat anomalous context says life bum
bum everyman
though low social scale bum beyond pale instance criminal
someone one society's values least recognizes certain social decorum
harry bum cadges subtly presence rather begging outright performs socially useful least desired role within small community bar habitués
harry remarks “they noticed harry bum

bukowski something hegelian recognizing mutual necessity lord bondsman

made clear harry “in agony another drink” suggests getting drink monk haircut “monk's eyes fixed harry ‘no we'll get beer i'm finished here’” 63

harry thinks thinking never presented traditional forms associate psychological characterization

individuals story lead unexamined lives bound routine convention habit anger feel determines lives “thirst” harry's
yet routineness characters lives results one story's impressive achievements skillful characterization
evident earlier nowhere skill handled much precision
“some hangover” “the death father ii” example characterization achieved dialogue significantly less “the life bum” brief strokes bukowski places character example mcduff harry meets way bar

neither comparisons order accidental leaves grow animals eat turn consumed humans
order things though particularly appealing one
mechanism world grinds
relentless cycle existence suggested fourth paragraph story “harry got relieved sink washed away spigot stuck head drank water” living becomes akin one statuefountains endlessly recycling water
one attempt break shortcircuit cycle harry's assault monk quite acte gratuit appears first glance
monk epitomizes harry dislikes “how sat
man's man
comfortable one
never thought death least own” later “monk laughed
laugh like linoleum sliced dull knife
maybe deathcry” harry monk monk's life death
way back bar harry tries realize identification monk walking next curb like dream
yellow dream
happened
harry know compulsion came
allowed compulsion
pretended trip lunged monk
monk like topheavy circus flesh fell front bus
driver hit brakes thud loud thud
65 monk breathing sign blood unconscious
harry takes wallet “leaped monk's back pocket impact” leaves
wallet full apparently monk's pay
thus element sensational introduced story
motivated terms harry's dislike monk feeling humiliated still slightly unrealistic element context overall tone style story although incident typically made credible description wallet's landing “like little pyramid” bukowski wants incident story way incident shows harry fact aggressive although aggression somewhat subtly phrased “but allowed compulsion” see harry taking control way done
bar walk haircut passive controlling manipulating flunky position get free drinks
previous behavior element economic rationality something else work harry know monk carrying lot cash therefore push path bus reason
monk's existence anathema monk humiliated
monk also humiliated harry bar “offering” demeaning “job” holding ladder monk washes windows
assault monk marks decisive shift story
harry longer innocuous victim
harry chooses monk victim number reasons
one sense everything monk irritates harry monk provoked harry offering “bum” job
serious offer monk attacked harry harry's sensitive point yet crux “bum's” existence refusal work
earlier story harry characterized “dog without day” harry gets day
monk lost fight “recognition” harry advanced “lordship” status though loses soon enough conflict chef
harry trying get outside whole tight conflictual circle organized around work hierarchical work relations cp
primary definition “bum” “a person avoids work sponges others”
reflects offered job chef “why hell everybody trying put work” 64
harry accept wagework relationship monk's money successfully momentarily escapes
later day harry goes good meal monk's money
looks shabby chef reluctant serve angrily relents
“now” said harry “i want porterhouse steak medium welldone french fries go easy grease
bring another beer now” chef loomed like angry cloud cleared went back refrigerator repeated act included bringing bottle slamming
6667 harry eats meal orders meal
finishing second meal “i'll more” harry told chef
“another porterhouse fries another beer please” “you not” chef screamed
“you pay get hell here” 68 harry
chef's reaction surprising first glance inexplicable
harry first entered restaurant chef thought applying dishwasher's job advertised window
reason chef's anger may disappointment can't fill job could mean washing dishes well subtle irritating discomfort feel someone playing role
habitués bar maintain sense superiority harry buying drinks therefore refusal monk's offer job particularly offend case chef
sees bum somehow work
twice story harry refuses job refusal justified horror existence existence mcduff monk chef
pays leaves restaurant continues bloomlike odyssey
early evening traffic beginning clog avenues cars
sun slanted behind
harry glanced drivers cars
seemed unhappy
world unhappy
people dark
people terrified disappointed
people caught traps
people defensive frantic
felt lives wasted
right
harry walked along
stopped traffic signal
moment strange feeling
felt person alive world
light turned green forgot
crossed street side continued
69 story ends
ending especially effective harry's brief epiphany taken back next sentence
“the life bum” seems best story bukowski ever written
language extremely impressive truly word wasted
metaphors similes strikingly effective
impressive also worked number major concerns relatively small confines gnawingly deadening routine everyday life quiet notsoquiet desperation much humanity irrational aggression individual group refusal work nicely delineated
generally speaking bukowski's stories fit quite well one critic termed “the debunking rhythm american short story” challenge[s] character's audience's assumptions world without substituting moreauthoritative knowledge stories constitute form knowledge challenge knowledge
…20 nicely provides framework within view stories “decline fall” “some hangover” “the life bum” quite capture specific stamp bukowski story
bukowski questions concept stable individual personality though sometimes often suggests well extent individual mercy surrounding social world almost always represented hostile group

span almost entire publishing career 1944 1990 almost half century
