however likely long known raw cynical pockmarked poet favours disenfranchised downandout loser misfit
pictured gruff wincing mug beer bottle clasped meaty fist eyes fixed seamy underbelly americana world lived knew well fame bought relief
reputation earnedto extent persona put many ways true part nature
man uncomfortable life especially way others lived
publication first brought notice post office 1970 novel experiences job worked eleven years
readers attracted stark prose attention unsightly details world souls men dried died
seen perhaps latter day traven narrative voice longer expressed hope uncovered treasure
bukowski's world little hope left except prospect simply enduring keeping one's soul matter many others fell wayside
attraction like grotesquery side show
public drawn insulted nose rubbed little dirt afterward could retreat safe lodgings mr clean existence
became enamoured bukowski's demotic style twenties happened purchase copy drowning fire burning flame
appealed directness tone vision american life seemed like new world version hieronymus bosch maybe verbal version diane arbus photos
heroes ones wrote recognizably tradition western poetry prone employ chiasmus synecdoche zeugma
worship dylan thomas example took way wales buoyed guinness friend broke boathouse lit candles sat writing desk hoping feed inspiration spirit
like many others attracted bukowski's apparent simplicity style broad palette came subject matter uncensored diction unfiltered visions materialist dream deferred
know everyone felt complimentary work many us loved younger suffered years entropy regard become comfortable cynical resigned
rawness become crudity
simplicity simplistic
subjects mundane
narratives flat
philosophy rancid
commitment flaccid
short chronographer underclass become pornographer class
bother man obviously much trouble life seemed go way insult impress others drunkenness bravado
look poet treats world readers disdain
recently discovered several posthumous collections bukowski's poems published fairly recentlyopen night black sparrow press sifting madness word line way night torn mad footsteps flash lightning behind mountain matters well walk fire harpercollins
even thought bukowski decades found reading exhilaration experienced years ago
time around however found something noticed bukowski often lyric poet exquisite sensibility
tactics uses writing seem subtler thoughtthrough originally gave credit
i'd like suggest others lost taste never found liking major poet worth reading begin standard image bukowski hard cynic drunken nihilist belied certain pieces
poem "unblinking grief" requiem dead lover example last cigarettes smoked loaves sliced lest taken wry sorrow drown spider wine
much simply dead dish ashes fist vanished air
terrible thing life finding gone
bukowski's childhood least part reveals poems anything carefree
relationship father founded fear violence
i'm inspired speculate amateur psychiatrist way cynicism nihilism unflinching visions heartless godless world spring depths damaged child
pretty harsh judgments father many poems reveal darker side poet's nature
"unblinking grief" exposes another side one vitality passion
concise eloquent affirmation life face life's denial
bukowski's power writer often height memorializes anticipates loss "1966 volkswagen minivan"
poet waiting lover return home soothe anxiety listening bach
still imagination allow peace
prays "please let diefirst becausei oldermuch older"
finally addresses spirit bach "i want totell everything allrightand red gold hair bespreadupon pillow again"
contrast many poems drunken arguments many women ends one agonized attempt hold back inevitable cruelties human condition final image suggests peace comfort magic love
cursory reading bukowski might reveal dark side little religion often look past palpable images despair disappointment surround
times blackest moments arrives conclusion haunted last hundred years western culture life attendant suffering inherent meaning
poet honestly say finds purpose suffering"even suffering mirage"or sees us broken spirits trapped automaton bodies"he like slab ofmeatin abutcher shop"he also finds dignity human ability suffer endure
unlike characters populating becket's universe bukowski's often ennobled stoical endurance jockey "a happening" whose wife committed suicide rides like "a tiger thesun" he's one us alone forever fiercely ignoring pain hear echo aeschylus lines
words entirely wrong assume machismo pose crowds compassion
accounts bukowski could difficult one observe social niceties
tended reclusive early years drink drugs violence welldocumented although question much bukowski hid behind carefully calculated persona aka
henry chinaski
nevertheless numerous examples bukowski's sentimental side much might try veil well genuine strain empathy others
take example poem "her son"
piece offers exquisite paradigm poet's ability feel way inside life another
returning funeral lover poet listens son tells much money making current job ignoring fact mother's "neglected lonely adult life"
poet takes sign son fact "endured" might believe
truth become one walking dead category bukowski assigns us
poignant final stanza sorrow expands include dead lover think used talk lovingly almost every night fell asleep
critics complained bukowski poem often get appear unshaped narratives come definite conclusion
often felt way
coupled bland diction metaphorical adjectival embellishment "faults" led conclusion bukowski lazy technique sometimes lacked imaginative engagement subject
spending time familiarizing poet's huge opus i've come around
contrary would argue narrative poems carefully constructed clear intent "to make real possible word page"
conscious aversion psychology movement poem toward explanation well clear preference objects rather subjects event rather commentary
russell harrison puts "in bukowski refusal psychologize closely connected preference metonymy things rather explanation" american dream essays charles bukowski
also anyone doubts effective kind narrative poem suggest teaching poems done class students enamoured poetry
taken clarity images utter lack pretension yet difficulty finding complex implications behind simple statements equally important respond well wry humour frequent presence work
one point topic needs mentioning
unresolved endings many poems result purposeful evasion typical resonant ending
instead leaves reader something like "she liked sweets pennsylvania" "she went bathroom kicked back popped bottle hvemeyer bernkastel riesling"
part endings also suggest poet never took seriouslyas poem finished connection longer important
attitude much poetics
doubt bukowski's sincerity reference poem like "notes poetry" offer reassurance
core poetics conviction faking emotion left academics dilettantes artist untruthfulness unforgivable
life bukowski fought becoming comfortable even become famous could finally afford live something dingy one room apartment
true artists never forget really forget less able write poem stands screams laughs page
bukowski stated jokingly believed "keeping bowels loose" serious discussing essence ars poetica
truth first direct route simplicity
word like butter avocados steak hot biscuits onion rings whatever really needed
almost could pick words eat end however true poems come like forces nature unasked unstoppable
advice writers "so want writer
bukowski puts way unless comes soul like rocket unless still would drive madness suicide murder bukowski often well
many poems exist like rockets page ready tear emotions lunge preconceptions sterile world passion ferocity truth made known
