[ 
Back to Issue Features ]The Word, the Look, the Way: Another Side of Charles Bukowski 
by John Carroll 
 It's 
  
  difficult to gauge how long the reputation of a writer like Charles 
  
  Bukowski will endure. However, it's more than likely that as long 
  
  as it does, he will be known as the raw, cynical, pockmarked poet 
  
  who favours the disenfranchised, the down-and-out, the loser and 
  
  the misfit. He is pictured as the gruff wincing mug, beer bottle 
  
  clasped in his meaty fist, eyes fixed on the seamy underbelly 
  
  of Americana, the world that he lived in and knew so well until 
  
  fame bought him some relief. This is a reputation that he earned-to 
  
  some extent, a persona that he put on, but in many ways a true 
  
  part of his nature. He was a man uncomfortable with life, especially 
  
  the way others lived it. 
  

 The publication that first brought him some notice was Post 
  
  Office (1970), a novel about his experiences in a job he worked 
  
  at for eleven years. Readers were attracted by the stark prose 
  
  and the attention to unsightly details of a world where the souls 
  
  of men dried up and died. He was seen as perhaps a latter day 
  
  B. Traven, but his narrative voice no longer expressed the hope 
  
  of an uncovered treasure. In Bukowski's world there was little 
  
  hope left, except the prospect of simply enduring and keeping 
  
  one's soul, no matter how many others fell by the wayside. His 
  
  attraction was then like the grotesquery of the side show. And 
  
  if the public was drawn to him, it was only to be insulted, and 
  
  have its nose rubbed a little in the dirt; afterward, it could 
  
  retreat to safe lodgings and a Mr. Clean existence. 
  



I became enamoured with Bukowski's demotic style when I was in 
  
  my twenties and happened to purchase a copy of his Drowning 
    
    in Fire, Burning in Flame. What appealed to me was the directness 
  
  of tone, and the vision of American life that seemed like a New 
  
  World version of Hieronymus Bosch, or maybe a verbal version of 
  
  Diane Arbus photos. I had other heroes, ones who wrote more recognizably 
  
  in the tradition of Western poetry, and who were more prone to 
  
  employ chiasmus, synecdoche, zeugma and so on. (My worship of 
  
  Dylan Thomas, for example, took me all the way to Wales where, 
  
  buoyed by Guinness, a friend and I broke into his boathouse, lit 
  
  candles and sat at his writing desk hoping to feed our inspiration 
  
  on his spirit.) But I, like many others, was attracted to Bukowski's 
  
  apparent simplicity of style, his broad palette when it came to 
  
  subject matter, his uncensored diction, and his unfiltered visions 
  
  of the materialist dream deferred. 
  

I know that not everyone has felt this complimentary about his 
  
  work, and many of us who loved him when we were younger have suffered 
  
  over the years an entropy of regard, as we have become comfortable, 
  
  cynical, or resigned. His rawness has become crudity. His simplicity, 
  
  simplistic. His subjects, mundane. His narratives, flat. His philosophy, 
  
  rancid. And his commitment to it, flaccid. In short, to some, 
  
  the chronographer of the underclass has become the pornographer 
  
  with no class. Why bother with a man who obviously had so much 
  
  trouble with life, who seemed to go out of his way to insult or 
  
  impress others with his drunkenness and bravado? Why look to a 
  
  poet who treats the world, and his readers, with such disdain? 
  

 Recently, I discovered several posthumous collections of Bukowski's 
  
  poems, all published fairly recently-Open All Night (Black 
  
  Sparrow Press); Sifting Through the Madness for the Word, the 
    
    Line, the Way; The Night Torn with Mad Footsteps; The Flash of 
    
    Lightning Behind the Mountain; and What Matters Most is How Well 
    
    You Walk Through the Fire (HarperCollins). I hadn't even thought 
  
  about Bukowski for decades, but I found myself reading him with 
  
  the same exhilaration I had experienced years ago. This time around, 
  
  however, I found something that I had not noticed before: Bukowski 
  
  is often a lyric poet of exquisite sensibility. The tactics he 
  
  uses in his writing now seem subtler and more thought-through 
  
  than I originally gave him credit for. I'd like to suggest to 
  
  others who have lost their taste for him, or to those who never 
  
  found him to their liking, that he is a major poet worth reading, 
  

 To begin with, the standard image of Bukowski as the hard cynic 
  
  and drunken nihilist is belied by certain pieces. The poem "unblinking 
  
  grief", a requiem for a dead lover, is an example: 
  



 the last cigarettes are smoked, the loaves are sliced, 
      and lest this be taken for wry sorrow, 
      drown the spider in wine. 
 you are much more than simply dead: 
      I am a dish for your ashes, 
      I am a fist for your vanished air. 
 the most terrible thing about life
      is finding it gone. 


 Bukowski's childhood, at least the part of it that he reveals 
                
                in his poems, was anything but carefree. His relationship with 
                
                his father was founded in fear and violence. I'm inspired to speculate, 
                
                in my amateur psychiatrist way, that all the cynicism, all the 
                
                nihilism, all the unflinching visions of a heartless and godless 
                
                world spring from the depths of a damaged child. And there are 
                
                some pretty harsh judgments of his father in many of his poems, 
                
                which do reveal the darker side of the poet's nature. But "unblinking 
                
                grief" exposes another side, one of vitality and passion. It is 
                
                a concise and eloquent affirmation of life in the face of life's 
                
                denial. 
                
              
 Bukowski's 
                
                power as a writer is most often at its height when he memorializes 
                
                or anticipates a loss, as in "1966 Volkswagen minivan." The poet 
                
                is waiting for his lover to return home, and to soothe his anxiety, 
                
                he is listening to Bach. Still, his imagination won't allow him 
                
                any peace. He prays, "please let me die/first because/I am older/much 
                
                older." Finally, he addresses the spirit of Bach: "I want you 
                
                to/tell me that everything is all/right/and that her red and gold 
                
                hair will be/spread/upon my pillow again." In contrast to his 
                
                many poems about drunken arguments with his many women, he ends 
                
                this one with an agonized attempt to hold back the inevitable 
                
                cruelties of the human condition; his final image suggests peace, 
                
                comfort, and the magic of love. 
                
              
A cursory reading of Bukowski might reveal only his dark side; 
                
                he has little religion and it's not often that he can look past 
                
                the palpable images of despair and disappointment that surround 
                
                him. At times, in his blackest moments, he arrives at the conclusion 
                
                that has haunted the last hundred years or so of Western culture: 
                
                life and its attendant suffering have no inherent meaning. But 
                
                if the poet can honestly say he finds no purpose in suffering-"even 
                
                your suffering is a mirage"-or if he sees most of us as broken 
                
                spirits trapped in automaton bodies-"he was like a /slab of/meat/in 
                
                a/butcher shop"-he also finds dignity in the human ability to 
                
                suffer and endure. Unlike the characters populating Becket's universe, 
                
                Bukowski's are often ennobled by their stoical endurance, as is 
                
                the jockey in "a happening" whose wife has committed suicide and 
                
                who now rides like "a tiger in the/sun": 
                
              


 he's each one of us
                    alone
                    forever
                    fiercely ignoring
                    the
                    pain


 I hear an echo of Aeschylus in these lines. 
                
              
In other words, it is entirely wrong to assume that his machismo, 
                
                pose or not, crowds out compassion. By all accounts, Bukowski 
                
                could be difficult; he was not one to observe social niceties. 
                
                He tended to be reclusive, and his early years of drink, drugs, 
                
                and violence are well-documented although there is some question 
                
                about how much of himself Bukowski hid behind a carefully calculated 
                
                persona (a.k.a. Henry Chinaski). Nevertheless, there are numerous 
                
                examples of Bukowski's sentimental side, as much as he might try 
                
                to veil it, as well as a genuine strain of empathy for others. 
                
              
 Take for example his poem "her only son." This piece offers 
                
                an exquisite paradigm of the poet's ability to feel his way inside 
                
                the life of another. Returning from the funeral of his lover, 
                
                the poet listens as her son tells him how much money he is making 
                
                at his current job, ignoring the fact of his mother's "neglected 
                
                and lonely / adult life." The poet takes this as a sign that the 
                
                son has not in fact "endured" as he might believe. In truth, he 
                
                has become one of those walking dead, a category to which Bukowski 
                
                assigns most of us. And in a poignant final stanza, the sorrow 
                
                expands to include his dead lover: 
                
              


 and to think
                    she used to
                    talk about
                    him lovingly
                    almost / every night
                    before we
                    fell
                    asleep. 


 Some critics have complained about how in a Bukowski poem we 
                
                often get what appear to be unshaped narratives that come to no 
                
                definite conclusion. I have often felt the same way. Coupled with 
                
                bland diction and no metaphorical or adjectival embellishment, 
                
                these "faults" led me to the conclusion that Bukowski was lazy 
                
                in his technique and that he sometimes lacked imaginative engagement 
                
                with his subject. But after spending more time familiarizing myself 
                
                with the poet's huge opus, I've come around. Now, on the contrary, 
                
                I would argue that most of his narrative poems are carefully constructed, 
                
                with the clear intent "to make as real as possible / the word 
                
                on the page." There is a conscious aversion to psychology and 
                
                to movement of the poem toward explanation, as well as a clear 
                
                preference for objects rather than subjects, and event rather 
                
                than commentary. As Russell Harrison puts it: "In Bukowski, the 
                
                refusal to psychologize is closely connected to the preference 
                
                for metonymy, for things, rather than explanation" (Against 
                  
                  the American Dream: Essays on Charles Bukowski). 
                
              
Also, if anyone doubts how effective this kind of narrative poem 
                
                can be, I suggest teaching his poems, as I have done, to a class 
                
                of students not enamoured by poetry. They are taken by the clarity 
                
                of his images and by the utter lack of pretension, yet they have 
                
                no difficulty finding more complex implications behind the simple 
                
                statements And, equally important: they respond well to his wry 
                
                humour which is a frequent presence in his work. 
                
              
 One other point on this topic needs mentioning. The unresolved 
                
                endings of many of his poems result from a purposeful evasion 
                
                of the typical resonant ending. Instead he leaves the reader with 
                
                something like, "She liked sweets and she was / from Pennsylvania," 
                
                or "she went to the bathroom / while I kicked back and / popped 
                
                a bottle of Hvemeyer / Bernkastel Riesling." In part, these endings 
                
                also suggest that the poet never took himself too seriously-as 
                
                if once the poem was finished, his connection with it was no longer 
                
                important to him. This attitude has much to do with his poetics. 
                
              
If there is any doubt about Bukowski's sincerity, reference to 
                
                a poem like "notes on some poetry" can offer reassurance. At the 
                
                core of his poetics is the conviction that faking emotion can 
                
                be left to the academics or the dilettantes; for an artist, untruthfulness 
                
                is unforgivable. All his life, Bukowski fought against becoming 
                
                too comfortable, even after he had become famous and could finally 
                
                afford to live in something more than a dingy one room apartment. 
                
                True artists never
                
              


 forget what we are really about
                    and the more we forget this
                    the less we are able to write a
                    poem that
                    stands and screams and laughs on
                    the page. 


 Bukowski stated jokingly that he believed in "keeping the / 
                
                bowels loose"; but he is at his most serious when discussing the 
                
                essence of his ars poetica. Truth first, and the most direct route 
                
                to that is through simplicity. 
                
              


 the word should be like butter or avocados or
                    steak or hot biscuits, or onion rings or
                    whatever is really needed. it should be almost
                    as if you could pick up the words and 
                    eat them


 In the end, however, true poems come into being like forces 
                
                of nature, unasked for and unstoppable. In his advice to writers 
                
                ("so you want to be a writer?"), Bukowski puts it this way: 
                
              


 unless it comes out of 
                    your soul like a rocket, 
                    unless being still would
                    drive you to madness or
                    suicide or murder, don't do it


 Bukowski did it and he often did it well. Many of his poems
