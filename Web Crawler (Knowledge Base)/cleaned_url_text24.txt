first human face saw sidewalk lost half charge right
monstrous blank dumb unfeeling face charged capitalism "grind"

still worth half left
yeah leisure
mean profound thoughts
mean thoughts
without thoughts progress without selfthoughts trying
justlike slug
beautiful
beauty thing beauty especially human facewhat call physiognomy
mathematical imagined alignment features
like nose stick much sides fashion earlobes large hair longit's kind mirage generalization
people think certain faces beautiful truly final measure
mathematical equation zero
"true beauty" comes course character
eyebrows shaped
many women i'm told beautifulhell like looking soup bowl
ugliness there's thing ugliness
thing called deformity outward "ugliness" existi spoken
upon time wintertime
starving death trying writer new york
eaten three four days
finally said "i'm gonna big bag popcorn"
god tasted food long good
kernel know one like steak
chewed would drop poor stomach
stomach would say "thank thank thank you"
heaven walking along two guys happened one said "jesus christ"
one said "what it"
"did see guy eating popcorn
god awful"
enjoy rest popcorn
thought mean "it awful"

knowto much accepted terrifying
feel done something wrong
enjoy bad things said
enhances [book] sales makes feel evil
like feel good 'cause good
evil
yes
gives another dimension
bringing pinky finger left hand ever see finger
finger seems paralyzed downward "l" configuration
broke drunk one night
know buti guess set right
works fine "a" key typewriter andwhat hellit adds character
see i've got character dimension
laughs
bravery socalled brave people lack imagination
though can't conceive would happen something went wrong
truly brave overcome imagination
fear know thing
laughs violence think violence often misinterpreted
certain violence needed
us energy demands outlet
think energy constrained go mad
ultimate peacefulness desire desirable area
somehow construction meant
like see boxing matches younger days i'd like duke back alleys
"expulsion energy honor" sometimes called violence
"interesting madness" "disgusting madness"
good bad forms violence
factit's loose term
let much expense others okay
physical pain kid used drill
big boils
toughen physical pain
general hospital drilling away guy walked said "i never saw anyone go needle cool"
that's bravery get enough physical pain relent process adjustment
mental pain can't adjusted
keep away
psychiatry psychiatric patients get
get bill
think problem psychiatrist patient psychiatrist goes book patient arrives life done
even though book may certain insights pages always book patient little bit different
many individual problems pages
get
many mad people saying "dollars per hour bell rings finished"
alone drive nearmad person madness
they've started open feel good shrink says "nurse make next appointment" they've lost track price also abnormal
stinking worldly
guy take ass
he's cure
wants money
bell rings bring next "nut"
sensitive "nut" realize bell rings he's fucked
there's time limit curing madness there's bills either
psychiatrists i've seen look little close edge
they're comfortablei think they're comfortable
think patient wants see little madness much
ahhhh
bored psychiatrists totally useless
next question
faith faith right
load
faith plumber eternal
plumbers good job
keep shit flowing
cynicism i've always accused cynic
think cynicism sour grapes
think cynicism weakness
saying "everything wrong
everything wrong"
know
"this right
right"
cynicism weakness keeps one able adjust occurring moment
yes cynicism definiteiy weakness optimism
"the sun shining birds singing smile"
that's bullshit
truth lies somewhere

ready handle ittoo bad
conventional morality may hell judge may create one
think people overtaught
overtaught everything
find happens react
i'll use strange term here"good"
know comes feel there's ultimate strain goodness born us
believe god believe "goodness" like tube running bodies
nurtured
always magic freeway packed traffic stranger makes room change lanesit gives hope
interviewed almost like caught corner
embarrassing
always tell total truth
like play around jest bit give misinformation sake entertainment bullshit
want know never read interview
ignore one
